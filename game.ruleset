; use your new customized file.

; Note that the freeciv AI may not cope well with anything more

You are playing Freeciv with rules designed for multiplayer gaming. \
The biggest differences from the default ruleset are that trade routes \
are disabled, and that most wonders can be built once by each player, \
and affect only cities on the same continent. A full description of \
the differences can be found in README.ruleset_multiplayer.\
